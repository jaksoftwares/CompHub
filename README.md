## 🚩 Problem Statement

Nairobi is a major hub for electronics, IT products, and mobile devices. However, shopping for these products remains **offline, unstructured, and inefficient**. Customers often spend hours navigating crowded streets like Moi Avenue, Luthuli Avenue, and Kimathi Street to compare options, prices, and authenticity — all without reliable guarantees.

Meanwhile, **small to mid-sized IT retailers** face limited online visibility. Many lack digital infrastructure and tools to compete or reach wider audiences, resulting in missed sales and growth opportunities.
